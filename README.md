# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
## Description
Alx's RSA Factoring Challenge is aimed at encouraging research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers and cracking RSA keys used in cryptography.
### Table of contents

* [0. Factorize all the things!](./factors)
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

* [1. RSA Factoring Challenge](./rsa)
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p × q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.
