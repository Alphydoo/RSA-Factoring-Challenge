# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
## Description
Alx's RSA Factoring Challenge is aimed at encouraging research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers and cracking RSA keys used in cryptography.
## Table of contents

* ### [0. Factorize all the things!](./factors)

Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

* ### [1. RSA Factoring Challenge](./rsa)

RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that
n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.
